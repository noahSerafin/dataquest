/* Your starting setup, determines starting money, lives, programs, and items.

MAP
Choose your path forward, there will always be an easy path to the left with two nodes (levels) at your currently security level(difficulty).
Alternatively, there may also be a harder path with greater rewards, an option receive a free program followed by a harder level, or other hidden rewards on a harder path.
Lock indicates difficulty of level, higher level enemy programs spawn at higher difficultirs
The preview will show you the layout of the level and the starting spawn points, red for enemies, blue for the player/

BOARD
The aim of the game is to get rid of all enemy programs (outlined in red) on a node. You lose if you end a turn with no programs on the board.
Once entering a node, you will be able to see what enemy programs you are up against, click on them to see their stats.
Start by placing a program on the board, either by dragging into the green spawn point or using the place button then clicking on the spawn.
Be aware you won't be able to move your program until after the enemy's turn, so make sure you're not going to be destoyed straight away.
On each turn, you may either place a new program next to one of your own, or move your already placed programs.
If you clear the board but the round doesn't finish, there's probably still a 'hidden' enemy piece in play.

SHOP
At the shop, you can buy new programs (P), new Admin prgrams (A), or consumable items (I)

ADMINS
Admins effects are passive, and all have different triggers. Admins with the same trigger will activate in the order you place them in your admin panel (left to right).

ITEMS
All items are consumable, they each take up 1 memory in your inventory, a resource shared with programs.
Some items can be used on programs in oyur inventory to permanently boost their stats, others give temporary boosts to programs already on the board.

Programs
Programs also take up 1 memory in your inventory.
Some programs have special moves, click on them to see what they are.

BOSSES
Bosses act like admin programs for the enemy, they may boost enemy stats, nerf yours, or add some other challenging effect to a node.
On defeating a boss, the shop will restock for free, and the security level of all future nodes will increase by one.
After defeating a level 6 Boss, you win the game.
